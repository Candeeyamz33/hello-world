New kid on the block

Hey there!

My name is Nikisha and I had a great day. I did not consume tacos on the moon, but I did have one fanatastic bowl of coconut curry soup. By far, my soup was much better than a taco. Please do not take it as a insult to the art of taco eating, or a disregard to that devinely crafted member of Latin cuisine. Don't mind me, I'm just filling lines with characters.
